# 🖥️ Blake Eldridge's Desktop Portfolio

Welcome to my **desktop-style portfolio**!  
Think of it as an interactive operating system – explore the windows, click the icons, and discover my projects, skills, and more.

## 🖱️ How to Explore

1. Hover over the dock on the left to toggle windows.
2. Drag, minimize, or maximize windows just like a real desktop.  
3. Click icons to jump to my social links or projects.

> Warning: The “Terminal” might brag about my gymnastics skills sometimes 😎
